pay to the Director to whom such Option was granted an amount in cash, for each
share of Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to such event,
equal to the excess of (A) the value, as determined by the Committee of the
property

(or the ultimate parent thereof) and, incident thereto, make an equitable
adjustment as determined by the Committee in the exercise price of such
exchanged option, and/or the number, type and class of securities subject to
such exchanged option or, if appropriate, provide for a cash payment to the
Director to whom such Option was granted in partial consideration for the
exchange of the Option.

In the event of the occurrence of any event described above, the
Committee shall, with respect to each Directors Option outstanding immediately
prior to such event (whether or not then vested or exercisable), take the action
described in clause (A) above, except that the value of the property received in
exchange for a share of Common Stock pursuant to such event shall be the Fair
Market Value of such property.
